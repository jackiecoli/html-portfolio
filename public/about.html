<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Jackie A. Colinares, a 4th-Year Computer Engineering student at Colegio de Muntinlupa.
  I am 22 years old. <br /> My hobbies are surfing the internet, going to coffee shops, and playing guitar.
  I have a big family, 3 older sisters<br /> and 2 older brothers. I have 2 nephews from one of them.
  The three older ones already moved out couple of years<br /> ago, so I'm currently living with my parents and two other siblings.
</p>

<p>I chose the program of Computer Engineering because of its wide opportunities after graudation even without<br />
    taking a board exam. The number one field that I really want to pursue is software engineering. I think it just<br/>
    seems reall cool. But I am really open to other opportunities such as data scientist, or network engineering.<br />
    I have one year left in college and I hope I make the best of it.
